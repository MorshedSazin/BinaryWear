        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm <span class="highlight">Morshed Alam Sajin</span>, a BCSE student at <span class="highlight">IUBAT</span> with a passion for technology, open-source software, and creative design. As a student, I launched <span class="highlight">Binarywear</span>, an online store that blends my love for Linux and free software with trendy, high-quality apparel and accessories.</p>
        <h2>Why Binarywear?</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">Binarywear</span> exists not just as a source of financial stability during my studies but also as a platform to promote the ideals of open-source software. Every product is a statement of support for free software and a celebration of the Linux community.</p>
        <p>Thank you for supporting this initiative! Together, letâ€™s champion free software and spread the love for Linux, one hoodie or cap at a time.</p>
